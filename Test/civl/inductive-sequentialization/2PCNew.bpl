// Protocol

// Coordinator asks every one some questions
// Everyone says yes or no (votes) to the coordinator
// If coordinator gets all yes then we commit otherwise no. 

// Everyone votes based on whether or not they already voted in a particular interval, if the coordinator says there was no commit then they remove that interval from their storage.

// Voting is the right mover phase?
